* There are 5 types of trash-bins on the ground (General, Paper, Metal, Organic, Plastic).
* User needs to drag-and-drop the trash items falling from the sky to its respective trash bin.
  * Every correct sort grants 100 points _(a changeable variable in the code settings)_
  * Every incorrect sort dedcuts 50 points _(a changeable variable in the code settings)_
* Time limit is 1 minute _(a changeable variable in the code settings)_

Obviously there are bugs but not major ones. It was my first time working with JS and its framework Phaser so I cannot figure out how to remove the bugs. What bugs? Maybe play and figure it out!

If you're feeling fancy feel free to upgrade the game.
